  Information
  ===========

This is source package for Cppreference C++ standard library reference documentation available at
<http://en.cppreference.com>. 

If there is no 'reference/' subdirectory in this package, the actual documentation is not present 
here and must be obtained separately in order to build the binary package. This can be done in two 
ways:

 1) Running `make source` which will pull the documentation directly from the website page-by-page.
 
 2) Downloading an already prepared archive from <http://en.cppreference.com/w/Cppreference:Archives>.
    This method is preferred.
    
Note, that abovementioned documentation is still a raw copy of the website and needs to be 
transformed in order to be suitable for local viewing. This step can be achieved by running `make`.
The result of the transformation will be placed at the 'output/' subdirectory.
