Information
===========

In order to build the documentation package, the html copy of the website must reside at the 
'reference/' directory. It can be obtained in two ways:

1) (preferred) Downloading a prepared raw archive from http://en.cpprefence.com/w/Cppreference:Archives and
   extracting in this directory.
   
2) Running `make source`. This would launch httrack network copier which will download the up to date
   copy of the website.
