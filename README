  Information
  ===========

This repository contains utility scripts for Cppreference C++ standard library reference
documentation available at <http://en.cppreference.com>. 

  Packaging process
  =================

The resources for making a package are separated into three parts for better maintainability.

  1) The C++ reference itself. It is maintained using MediaWiki content management system and resides
     at 
         <http://en.cppreference.com>
  
  2) Utility scripts used to used to transform a raw copy of the website into an version suitable 
     for offline viewing. They are maintained using a git repository at 
     
         <https://github.com/p12tic/cppreference-doc>
     
  3) Debian packaging information. It is maintained using a git repository at 
   
         <https://github.com/p12tic/cppreference-doc-debian>
     
The (1) and (2) parts must be combined prior any attemts to package the documentation. This can be 
done by extracting (2) in some directory and either running `make source` there, or downloading and 
extracting a prepared archive of (1) at 

    <http://en.cppreference.com/w/Cppreference:Archives>

In both cases the documentation should appear in the 'reference/' subdirectory.

Then the documentation can be transformed into a version suitable for offline viewing and installed
by either usual `make && make install` or by creating a debian package.
